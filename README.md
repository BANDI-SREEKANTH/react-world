Hi Everyone, I recently created a simple React app using Parcel as the build tool. Parcel helps improve the performance of a React application and fast in buidling dev builds and production builds. Unlike the `create-react-app` command, which uses Webpack for builds in 'create-react-app', Parcel allows for better optimization of the application.

Usages of Parcel:
It boosts the react application very fast. Because of the fallowing advantages
1.	Dev Build.
2.	Local Server.
3.	HMS – Hot Module Replacement (Hot loading) (Browser page automatically refresh).
4.	File Watching Algorithm (It is written in cpp).
5.	Parcel gives faster builds because of caching. (Faster Builds).
6.	Image Optimization. (It is very costly operation to load images in webpages).
7.	Minification of production build.
8.	Bundling.
9.	Compressing files.
10. Consitent Hashing.
11. Code Splitting.
12. Differential Bundling -- (React application in older browsers version, it supports it).
13. Diagnostic.
14. Error Handling.
15. To host application on HTTPs.
16. Tree shaking algorithm. (Will remove unused code)
17. Different dev and prod builds.
